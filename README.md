# GoFish
A fully featured game of GoFish written in Ruby

Following Zed A. Shaw's Learn Ruby the Hard Way, programmed independently with no instruction.
Go Fish is a game with very little strategy but robust logic.
Dreadfully feature rich. The next implementation should ideally be minimalistic.

To open, download all files excluding the Test files and run GoFish.rb in Ruby interpreter.
