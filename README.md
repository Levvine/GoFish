# GoFish
A fully featured game of GoFish written in Ruby

Following Zed A. Shaw's Learn Ruby the Hard Way, programmed independently with no instruction.
Go Fish is a game with very little strategy but robust logic.

This project went a little overboard with the features. For example, the game class GoFish was written without much hard coded aside from the game logic. The number of players, the deck used, and the number of cards dealt can all be changed by modifying one or two variables rather than rewriting large segments of the program. The classes Player, Hand, and Deck are extensible and written with the ability to use different Card classes as a plugin. The next implementation should ideally be minimalistic, to save time. The scope of this project escaped a realistic time frame.


To open, download all files excluding the Test files and run GoFish.rb in Ruby interpreter.
